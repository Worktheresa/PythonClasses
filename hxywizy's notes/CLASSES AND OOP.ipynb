    "A class is a user defined prototype that defines a set of attributes (data members or variables) and methods that characterises any class object. An object is a unique instance of a class. So far we have been working with objects and these objects belong to Python built-in classes. For better understanding, suppose we create a variable named 'fruit' and we assign to it a string value of \"Banana\". Then, \"Banana\" stored in the fruit variable is an object that belongs to the Python String class. With the object, we can access all attributes of the class."

    "Abstraction is an OOP concept that allows a programmer to hide the real implementation and users only know how to use it. In Python, we use abstract classes and interface to achieve abstraction.  An abstract class is a class that provides incomplete functionality and contains at least one abstract method.

Concrete methods are methods that have implementation. "

Methods which provide common functionality to be used for all derived classes are defined as concrete methods in abstract class where as the methods where implementation may vary are defined as abstract methods.\n",
    "3. Abstract class can’t be instantiated so it is not possible to create objects of an abstract class.\n",
